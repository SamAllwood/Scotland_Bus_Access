## Bus Accessibility Metrics {auto-animate="true"}

- Published by Transport Scotland in 2017 and 2019 by datazone
- Derived from numbers of buses per hour serving the datazone, ajusted to emphasise peak periods
- No update in 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic and no updates currently foreseen
- Plotting Change between 2017 and 2019, it is clear why they have stopped publishing the data!

## Strathclyde Partnership for Transport Area

A good majority of the countryside has the same bus accessibility. But the populated areas have reduced access. 
Not good news if you live in Glasgow!

SIMD quintiles are set at the national level, and West of Scotland has more highly deprived areas than it should. 

## Glasgow City Council Area

Even worse news in Glasgow if you're in the more deprived areas!

But! The quintiles are measured across the whole of Scotland, so there are uneven numbers in West of Scotland
(and likewise for Glasgow). The percentages show the proportion of the quintile datazones in the region. 
E.g. 35% of the 1st quintile of deprivation have had reduced bus services. 

How can we present to demonstrate the inequality of bus accessibility reduction? 
Rather than just showing how much deprivation is concentrated in West of Scotland...

The SIMD includes a ranking of the Datazones across Scotland. We can use that to calculate
quintiles of deprivation within each area. 

## Locally derived deprivation quintiles

Across the West of Scotland, the reductions in bus accessibility are greater in areas of higher deprivation.

The same is not true in Glasgow, though a reduction of services to 33% of the population over 2 years is unsustainable.
